Roughly magpie-sized (up to 0.5 m long), it combined avian features (broad, flight-capable wings and advanced feather impressions) with classic theropod traits (sharp-toothed jaws, three-fingered claws, long bony tail, and a hyperextensible second toe). Because it bridges non-avian dinosaurs and modern birds, Archaeopteryx is celebrated as one of the most important transitional fossils in vertebrate evolution. First known from a single feather described in 1861, twelve more body-fossil specimens have since surfaced—almost all from the Solnhofen limestone quarries. The “London” specimen (1861) and the more complete “Berlin” specimen (1874–75) remain the best-preserved examples. These fossils not only bolstered early acceptance of Darwin’s theory of evolution but also established that feathers arose before true birds, reshaping our understanding of dinosaur–bird relationships.\")\n",

    "text4 = (\"Quetzalcoatlus northropi is one of the largest known pterosaurs—and indeed one of the largest flying animals ever to have lived. Named for the feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl of Aztec mythology and paleontologist John Northrop, it soared the skies of what is now western North America during the Late Cretaceous, roughly 70–66 million years ago. With an estimated wingspan of 10–11 meters (33–36 feet), Quetzalcoatlus combined ultra-light, hollow bones and an aerodynamic skull crest to remain airborne. Its long, slender beak lacked teeth, suggesting a feeding strategy focused on small vertebrates or carrion rather than fish snatching; its robust hind limbs imply a terrestrial stalking style, picking prey on shorelines or inland plains before taking flight in powerful strokes of its membranous wings. Fossils of Quetzalcoatlus were first uncovered in the 1970s within the Maastrichtian deposits of Big Bend National Park, Texas. Unlike the marine pterosaurs found closer to ancient shorelines, these specimens came from inland floodplain sediments—evidence that some giant pterosaurs thrived far from the coasts. As both apex aerial predators and efficient scavengers, Quetzalcoatlus and its kin help paint a richer picture of Late Cretaceous ecosystems, where the mastery of flight unlocked entirely new niches among Mesozoic reptiles.\")\n"
